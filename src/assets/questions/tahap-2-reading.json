        "question_body": "<b>Earthquakes: Shaking the Ground Beneath Us</b>\n\nEarthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when the Earth's tectonic plates suddenly shift, releasing energy that travels through the ground. These movements can cause significant shaking, especially near fault lines—cracks in the Earth's crust where these plates meet. The strength of an earthquake is measured on the Richter scale, which ranges from minor tremors barely felt by people to catastrophic quakes that can destroy buildings and infrastructure.\n\nMost earthquakes happen along the boundaries of tectonic plates. For example, the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, experiences frequent seismic activity due to its many active fault lines. In addition to ground shaking, earthquakes can also trigger secondary disasters such as landslides, tsunamis, and fires, especially in urban areas.\n\nAlthough scientists cannot predict exactly when or where an earthquake will strike, <b>they have developed tools to <u>assess</u> earthquake risk.</b> Seismographs are instruments that record the intensity and duration of ground movement. Geological studies and historical data also help experts identify high-risk zones and improve building codes to make structures more resistant to seismic forces.\n\nUnderstanding how earthquakes work and how to prepare for them is essential, particularly for those living in high-risk regions. Emergency drills, early warning systems, and public education can significantly reduce the impact of these natural events on human life and property.",
